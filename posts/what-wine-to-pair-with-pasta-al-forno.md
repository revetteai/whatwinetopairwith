## Chianti Classico

Chianti Classico, with its Sangiovese grapes, is a classic match for Italian dishes like Pasta Al Forno. Its medium body and high acidity perfectly balance the dish's tomato sauce, cutting through the richness of the melted cheese and any meaty flavors. The cherry and earthy notes harmonize beautifully with herbs and spices, enhancing the overall dining experience with every bite and sip.

## Barbera d'Alba

For those seeking an alternative to the usual suspects, Barbera d'Alba is a fantastic choice. This wine offers a great depth of flavor with bright acidity and lower tannins, complementing the dish without overshadowing it. Its plum and black cherry flavors add a fruity, fresh perspective to Pasta Al Forno, while its light oaky undertones align well with baked cheese and savory meat finishes.

## Primitivo

Primitivo, known in the U.S. as Zinfandel, pairs excellently with Pasta Al Forno thanks to its robust and juicy profile. This wine's rich flavors like blackberry, fig, and cinnamon effortlessly complement the tangy tomato sauce and savory depth of the meat and cheese layers. Its moderate tannins and bright acidity provide a balanced counterpoint to the dish’s hearty ingredients, making each mouthful a pleasure.

## Sauvignon Blanc

For those preferring white wine, consider Sauvignon Blanc as a refreshing pairing option. Its crisp acidity and vibrant citrus notes create a contrast that cuts through the creaminess of the cheese and highlights the savory components of the Pasta Al Forno. Offering a light, zesty finish, this wine refreshes the palate and enhances the subtle herbaceous elements of the dish.

## Aglianico

A more robust option, Aglianico stands as a powerful companion to Pasta Al Forno. This full-bodied red wine, with its ripe plum and black cherry flavors, adds a depth that matches the intensity of the dish. Its firm tannins and smoky undertones add a rich complexity, complementing the earthy and meaty layers present in the pasta while delivering a lingering, satisfying finish.
