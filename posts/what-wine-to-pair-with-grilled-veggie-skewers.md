## Sauvignon Blanc
For those who prefer white wine, Sauvignon Blanc is a fantastic option for grilled veggie skewers. Its bright acidity and herbaceous notes provide a refreshing contrast to the grilled vegetables.

## Rosé
Rosé is a versatile wine that can pair well with a wide range of dishes, including grilled veggie skewers. Its fruit-forward flavors and light, refreshing body make it an ideal choice for summer gatherings. The wine's acidity and dryness also help to balance out the smokiness from the grilled veggies, creating a well-rounded pairing.

## Zinfandel
If you're looking for a bolder wine to pair with your grilled veggie skewers, Zinfandel is an excellent option. Its full body and jammy fruit flavors can hold up to the variety of flavors from the grilled vegetables. The wine's tannins also help to enhance the smoky flavors from the grill, creating a robust and satisfying pairing.
