Whether you prefer a bold red or a crisp white, we have curated a list of both popular and creative options to complement your next meal.

## Chardonnay

Chardonnay is an excellent choice for Chicken Alfredo due to its full-bodied character and rich flavor profile. It offers notes of butter and oak, which seamlessly meld with the creamy sauce of the dish. Opt for a lightly oaked Chardonnay to avoid overwhelming the dish, providing a harmonious balance while enhancing the flavors of the chicken and sauce. The slight acidity in Chardonnay also helps to cleanse your palate, making every bite fresh and delightful.

## Pinot Noir

For those who prefer red wine, Pinot Noir pairs surprisingly well with Chicken Alfredo. Its light body and elegant flavor profile, with notes of cherry and earthy undertones, complement the dish without overpowering it. Pinot Noir’s low tannin level ensures a smooth interaction with the creamy sauce, making it a versatile choice for both red wine enthusiasts and Chicken Alfredo lovers alike.

## Sauvignon Blanc

Sauvignon Blanc brings a refreshing contrast to the richness of Chicken Alfredo with its crisp acidity and vibrant citrus notes. This wine adds a zesty edge that cuts through the creamy texture, keeping your palate engaged throughout the meal. Its herbaceous flavors also complement any herbs used in the dish, making it a zippy and invigorating pairing option.
