Its citrusy undertones and refreshing minerality cleanse the palate, allowing each bite of the carnitas to shine.

## Pinot Noir

Pinot Noir is a versatile red wine that pairs wonderfully with the complex flavors of Pork Carnitas. Its earthy undertones and well-balanced acidity complement the savory elements of the dish, while the red fruit flavors enhance its sweetness. The smooth, light body of Pinot Noir ensures it won't overpower the meal, making it an ideal choice for a laid-back dinner.

Viognier offers an adventurous alternative for pairing with Pork Carnitas. This aromatic white wine showcases flavors of peach, honeysuckle, and apricot, which contrast delightfully with the savory and spicy pork.

Grenache, with its robust fruitiness and subtle spice, is another excellent red wine option for Pork Carnitas.
