This pairing creates a luxurious and full-bodied experience, perfect for those who enjoy a touch of indulgence in their meals.

## Rosé

Rosé offers a playful and versatile choice that bridges the gap between red and white wine for Chicken Milanese.

Its lighter structure and berry notes add a cheerful brightness to the meal, making it a fantastic option for any occasion, from casual lunches to elegant dinners.

## Did You Know?

Did you know that wine corks can reveal much about a bottle’s storage conditions? A wine cork that's pushed out from the bottle may indicate exposure to heat, which can compromise the wine's quality. Moreover, over 70% of the world's wine corks come from Portugal, specifically from the bark of the cork oak tree. This renewable resource is harvested every nine years without harming the tree, making cork a sustainable option for wine packaging.

In conclusion, whether you favor a crisp white, a bold red, or a lively Rosé, pairing the right wine with Chicken Milanese enhances the flavors of both the wine and the dish.
