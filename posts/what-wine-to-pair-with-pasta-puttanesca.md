## Chianti Classico

Chianti Classico is a well-known red wine that makes an excellent pairing for Pasta Puttanesca. The high acidity in Chianti Classico matches beautifully with the tomato-based sauce, while the wine's tart cherry and earthy undertones blend well with olives, capers, and anchovies. Its tannins help balance out the rich flavors of the dish, making every bite more enjoyable.

## Barbera d'Asti

A lesser-known but equally delightful pairing is Barbera d'Asti. This Italian red offers fresh acidity and gentle tannins, making it a versatile companion for Pasta Puttanesca. The wine's notes of dark berries, spice, and herbs resonate with the complex flavors of the sauce, while its vibrant finish cleanses the palate, readying it for another delicious morsel.

## Vermentino

If you prefer white wine, Vermentino is an intriguing option that pairs well with Pasta Puttanesca. This Italian white wine provides a crisp and refreshing counterpoint to the dish, with aromas of citrus, herbal notes, and a touch of salinity mirroring the briny nuances of olives and capers. The wine's lively acidity enhances the tomato sauce, creating a harmonious dining experience.

## Nero d'Avola

For those who enjoy a bold red wine, Nero d'Avola is a fantastic choice. Originating from Sicily, this wine carries flavors of dark fruits, spices, and a hint of earthiness that pair well with the bold components of Pasta Puttanesca. Its full-bodied character and structured tannins make for a robust balance with the dish's rich and piquant elements.

## Fiano

For an unconventional and delightful pairing, consider Fiano, a white wine from Southern Italy. With its medium body, balanced acidity, and layers of tropical fruit and honeyed notes, Fiano complements the savory, slightly spicy elements in Pasta Puttanesca. This wine's unique profile offers a fresh take on enjoying this beloved Italian pasta dish.

## Did You Know?

Remember to delight in your wine responsibly!
