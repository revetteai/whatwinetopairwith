## Chianti Classico

Chianti Classico is a classic choice for a Roast Leg Of Lamb. This wine's acidity and tannins cut through the lamb’s richness, while its herbal notes complement the dish’s seasoning. The Sangiovese grape gives the wine bright cherry and plum flavors that pair beautifully with rosemary or garlic-rubbed roasts. Chianti Classico is a versatile and always impressive option.

Known for its peppery, smoky notes, Syrah is an excellent wine pairing for Roast Leg Of Lamb. Its full-bodied profile and spicy aromas highlight the savory aspects of the lamb, while its rich fruit flavors enhance the meat’s natural sweetness. This makes it a fantastic choice for those who enjoy a bit of boldness in their wine. Whether from the Rhône Valley or an Australian Shiraz, this wine delivers complexity and depth.

## Grenache Blanc

For those who lean towards white wine, Grenache Blanc is a refreshing option.

Its slight minerality adds another layer of interest, making it an unexpected but delightful companion to a Roast Leg Of Lamb. This wine works wonderfully when you want a lighter pairing without sacrificing flavor.
