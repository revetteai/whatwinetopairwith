## Did You Know?

Wine pairing is not just about tradition; it's an evolving art influenced by regional cuisines and varietal discoveries. In France, wine and food pairing is a cherished custom, where the principle of "terroir" connects dishes with wines from the same region. Interestingly, the concept of "terroir" is believed to enhance the dining experience by aligning the flavors of the food and wine, both of which are shaped by the same environmental factors. This is why regional pairings often feel so natural and harmonious—an idea that inspires food lovers to experiment with local and lesser-known wine varietals.
