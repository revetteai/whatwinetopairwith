## Chardonnay
A classic wine pairing for seafood, Chardonnay's buttery and creamy notes perfectly complement the rich and indulgent flavors of lobster ravioli. Look for a Chardonnay from California or Burgundy for a well-balanced and flavorful pairing.

## Pinot Noir
For those who prefer red wine, Pinot Noir is an excellent choice for lobster ravioli. The light-bodied and fruity nature of this wine pairs well with the delicate flavors of the dish and won't overpower it. Look for a Pinot Noir from Oregon or New Zealand for a refreshing and elegant pairing.

## Prosecco
For a bubbly and fun pairing, try a glass of Prosecco with your lobster ravioli. The sparkling wine's crispness and acidity cut through the richness of the dish, while its fruity and floral notes add a refreshing touch. Plus, the effervescence of Prosecco makes for a delightful palate cleanser between bites.

Another popular choice for seafood, Sauvignon Blanc's herbaceous and citrusy flavors make it a great pairing for lobster ravioli. The wine's bright acidity will balance out the creaminess of the dish and bring out its flavors. Look for a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand or the Loire Valley for a zesty and refreshing pairing.
