## Chardonnay

Chardonnay is a classic pairing for Roasted Chicken, particularly because of its buttery, oaked variations. The creamy texture and hints of vanilla enhance the savory notes of the roasted skin, creating a balanced profile.

## Pinot Noir

Pinot Noir is an excellent choice for its medium body and gentle tannins, which won't overpower the delicate flavor of the chicken. The wine's earthy undertones match well with the herbs often used in roasting, highlighting both the dish and the drink.

## Viognier

For a lesser-known option, try Viognier. This aromatic white wine offers floral scents and a hint of stone fruits, which can amplify the herbal bouquet of roasted chicken and provide a fresh contrast to the crispy skin.

## Grenache

Another intriguing choice is Grenache, a versatile red with subtle spice and berry notes. Its fruity profile and moderate acidity offer a delightful counterpoint to the herbs and tender meat found in Roasted Chicken, making it an unexpected yet delightful companion.
