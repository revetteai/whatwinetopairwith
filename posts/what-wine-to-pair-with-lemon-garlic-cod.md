When it comes to pairing wine with seafood, many people default to white wine. However, Lemon Garlic Cod is a versatile dish that pairs well with a range of wines, from crisp whites to bold reds. Here are some of the best wine pairings for Lemon Garlic Cod:

## Sauvignon Blanc

The bright, citrus flavors of Sauvignon Blanc make it a perfect pairing for Lemon Garlic Cod. The wine's crisp acidity cuts through the rich flavors of the garlic and complements the tangy lemon. Look for a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc for a more intense flavor profile or a French Sancerre for a more subtle pairing.

## Chardonnay

For a bolder pairing, try a Chardonnay with your Lemon Garlic Cod. The buttery notes in the wine will enhance the richness of the dish, while the oakiness adds depth to the flavors. Look for a California or Australian Chardonnay for a more full-bodied option, or a French Chablis for a lighter, mineral-driven pairing.

## Pinot Noir

If you prefer red wine, a Pinot Noir is a great option to pair with Lemon Garlic Cod. The light-bodied wine won't overpower the delicate fish, and the red fruit flavors will complement the lemon and garlic. Look for a Pinot Noir from Oregon or Burgundy for a classic pairing, or a New Zealand Pinot Noir for a more fruit-forward option.

## Rosé

For a refreshing and unexpected pairing, try a dry rosé with your Lemon Garlic Cod. The wine's crisp acidity and fruity notes will balance out the richness of the dish, while the light body won't overpower the delicate flavors. Look for a Provence rosé for a classic pairing, or a Spanish rosé for a more unique option.

In conclusion, when it comes to pairing wine with Lemon Garlic Cod, the key is to choose a wine with bright acidity and light to medium body. Whether you prefer white or red wine, there are many options that will enhance the flavors of this delicious seafood dish. Don't be afraid to experiment and find your perfect pairing!
