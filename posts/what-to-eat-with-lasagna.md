Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is loved by many for its rich layers of pasta, meat, and cheese. But sometimes, it can be difficult to figure out what to serve with this hearty meal. Luckily, we have put together a list of the best pairings for Lasagna to help elevate your dining experience.

## Garlic Bread
No Italian meal is complete without a side of garlic bread. The crispiness of the bread combined with the savory garlic and butter perfectly complements the richness of lasagna. Plus, it's a great way to soak up any extra sauce left on your plate.

## Caesar Salad
For a lighter option, a Caesar salad is a perfect pairing for Lasagna. The crispness of the lettuce, the tanginess of the dressing, and the crunch of croutons provide a nice contrast to the creamy texture of lasagna. Plus, the flavors of the salad help to cut through the richness of the dish.

## Roasted Vegetables
If you're looking to add some veggies to your meal, roasted vegetables are a great choice. The caramelized flavors from roasting bring out the natural sweetness of the vegetables, making them the perfect accompaniment to the savory lasagna. Try roasting some zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers for a colorful and delicious side dish.

## Red Wine
A glass of red wine is a classic pairing for Italian food, and lasagna is no exception. The tannins in red wine help to balance out the richness of the dish, while the fruity flavors complement the tomato sauce. Opt for a Chianti or a Sangiovese for the best pairing.

## Tiramisu
For a sweet ending to your lasagna dinner, try pairing it with a classic Italian dessert, Tiramisu. The layers of coffee-soaked ladyfingers, creamy mascarpone cheese, and cocoa powder complement the layers of pasta, meat, and cheese in the lasagna. It's a match made in Italian food heaven.

Next time you're planning a lasagna dinner, consider adding one or more of these pairings to elevate your dining experience. Whether you're in the mood for something light or want to indulge in some rich flavors, there's a perfect side dish or drink to go with your lasagna. Buon appetito!
