## Syrah/Shiraz

A bold Syrah or Shiraz can be an excellent choice when looking to pair wine with Moroccan Lamb. The rich flavors of blackberry and plum in this wine beautifully complement the lamb's succulent texture and spices like cumin and coriander. Its full body and slightly spicy undertones enhance the dish, making each bite a flavorful delight.

## Grenache

Grenache offers lighter tannins and bright acidity, making it a delightful pairing for Moroccan Lamb. The wine's red fruit notes, such as ripe cherry and raspberry, help balance the savoriness of the meat and its spices.
