Zinfandel, a popular choice among red wine aficionados, offers a bold and fruity flavor that complements the savory spices of Chicken Shawarma. The wine's rich berry flavors and smoky undertones work well with the grilled aspects of shawarma, often offering a hint of pepperiness that mirrors the dish’s own spice notes. Its robust nature makes it a fitting match for both the chicken and any additional accompaniments.

## Viognier

Viognier is a fantastic white wine pairing with Chicken Shawarma, known for its floral and stone fruit flavors.
