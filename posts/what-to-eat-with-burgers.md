Here are some delicious and unexpected foods to enjoy with your next burger.

## Crispy French Fries

It's no secret that burgers and fries go hand in hand. The crispy, salty goodness of french fries provides the perfect contrast to the juicy and savory burger. Whether you opt for classic fries or try a unique twist like sweet potato fries, this classic pairing is a match made in heaven.

## Creamy Coleslaw

For a refreshing and crunchy addition to your burger, try pairing it with some creamy coleslaw. The cool and tangy flavor of the coleslaw complements the rich and savory burger perfectly. Plus, the added texture of the coleslaw adds an extra layer of satisfaction to each bite.

## Grilled Pineapple

For a tropical twist on your burger, try adding some grilled pineapple. The sweetness of the pineapple pairs well with the savory burger, creating a delicious balance of flavors. Plus, the grill marks on the pineapple add some extra smokiness to the burger, taking it to the next level.

## Spicy Jalapenos

If you're a fan of spice, then adding some jalapenos to your burger is a must-try. The heat from the jalapenos adds a kick of flavor to the burger and is a great way to add some extra heat without overpowering the overall taste. For an even more flavorful experience, try pickled jalapenos for a tangy and spicy twist.

## Ice Cold Beer

Whether you prefer a light lager or a hoppy IPA, a cold beer is the perfect accompaniment to a juicy burger.
