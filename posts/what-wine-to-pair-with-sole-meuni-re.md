## Chablis

Chablis, a variety of Chardonnay from France's Burgundy region, is an excellent match for Sole Meunière. Its crisp acidity and mineral character highlight the buttery richness of the dish without overwhelming it. The fresh citrus notes in Chablis bring a vibrant contrast that enhances the subtle flavors of the sole.

## Sancerre

Sancerre, a Sauvignon Blanc from the Loire Valley, offers a refreshing accompaniment to Sole Meunière.
