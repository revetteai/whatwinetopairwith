## Best Wine to Pair With Chicken Saltimbocca

Finding the best wine for Chicken Saltimbocca can elevate your dining experience. This classic Italian dish, featuring chicken, sage, and prosciutto all cooked in a buttery white wine sauce, begs for a wine pairing that can complement its rich and savory flavors. Whether you're hosting a dinner party or treating yourself to a special meal, selecting the right wine will enhance the intricate taste profiles of Chicken Saltimbocca. Below are some top wine pairing options that range from bold reds to refreshing whites, each perfectly suited to enhance your dinner.

## Chianti Classico

Chianti Classico is a popular choice due to its superb acidity and earthy undertones that contrast beautifully with the savory and herbal elements of Chicken Saltimbocca. The cherry and plum flavors with subtle hints of herbs complement the sage while brightening up the prosciutto. This pairing offers a classic Italian match, making the overall dining experience authentic and enjoyable.

## Pinot Grigio

For a more refreshing option, consider Pinot Grigio. This white wine's crisp and citrusy notes provide a lovely contrast to the rich and buttery sauce in Chicken Saltimbocca. Pinot Grigio is light enough not to overpower the dish while its acidity enhances the freshness of the chicken, creating a harmonious bite.

## Sauvignon Blanc

Sauvignon Blanc is another excellent choice for those who prefer white wine. Known for its invigorating acidity and zesty flavors of green apple and lime, it adds an exciting layer to the dish. The herbal notes in the wine can accentuate the sage, bringing out even more depth in the Chicken Saltimbocca.

## Barbera d’Alba

This Italian red offers a fruity and approachable profile with enough acidity to cut through the richness of Chicken Saltimbocca. Barbera d’Alba has flavors of cherry, raspberry, and a hint of spice, which matches well with the savory prosciutto and sage. Its versatility makes it a reliable option for those who enjoy either reds or whites.

## Vermentino

Vermentino is a lesser-known, yet excellent choice. This white wine from Italy's coastal regions provides a floral aroma with flavors of green apple and pear. Its mineral undertones work well with the earthy sage and enhance the delicate flavors without overshadowing the dish's complexity. Vermentino makes for a sophisticated and unique pairing.
